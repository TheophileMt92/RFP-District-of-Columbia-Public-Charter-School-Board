    -   Completion of Iteration 4: 25% (\$7,350.00)
    -   Completion of Iteration 5: 25% (\$7,350.00)
    -   Final Delivery (Iteration 7): 25% (\$7,350.00)

4.  **Additional Services**: Any requested services beyond the scope defined in the RFP would be billed at our standard hourly rate of \$60.00, but only after written approval from DC PCSB.

    -   DC PCSB will provide timely feedback after each iteration
    -   DC PCSB will provide data access and necessary technical documentation
    -   The project timeline allows for the 7 iterations as specified in the RFP
