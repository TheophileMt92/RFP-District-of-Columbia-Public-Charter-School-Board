## 1. Introduction  

We are pleased to submit this proposal for the development of public-facing, web-based ASPIRE outcome reports for DC Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB). Our team brings extensive experience in creating dynamic, accessible, and responsive data visualization solutions. We will deliver high-quality HTML-based reports using Quarto, Python, SQL, and GitLab to meet and exceed DC PCSB’s needs.

## 2. Understanding of the Project  

We understand DC PCSB requires two distinct types of ASPIRE outcome reports for each public charter school campus:  

1. **Type 1 Reports**: Educate the public about the ASPIRE system and display Measure Rates by student subgroup.  
2. **Type 2 Reports**: Include Type 1 content along with Measure Scores, Floors, and Targets.  

**Additional Requirements:**  
- Reports will be generated using Quarto, Python, and SQL scripts hosted on GitLab.  
- Must be mobile-friendly, ADA-compliant, and use progressive disclosure to present information.  
- Data provided by DC PCSB will be in publication-ready tables from AWS Data Warehouse.  
- Reports will dynamically handle variability across schools and frameworks, including scenarios with missing or suppressed data.  

Our team is well-equipped to meet these technical and functional requirements while adhering to DC PCSB’s standards for accessibility, maintainability, and user-centered design.

## 3. Approach  

### **3.1 Project Management**  
An experienced **Product Manager** (Yan Holtz) will oversee all aspects of the project, including:  
- Serving as the primary point of contact for DC PCSB.  
- Conducting sprint planning, managing feedback loops, and ensuring timely delivery.  
- Overseeing quality assurance (QA) for data accuracy, functionality, and visual design.  

### **3.2 Development Process**  
We propose the following phased approach to deliver the reports:  

**Phase 1: Planning and Design (Weeks 1–3)**  
- Collaborate with DC PCSB to finalize report templates for the 12 ASPIRE frameworks.  
- Create a cohesive design system using CSS/YAML to ensure consistent aesthetics.  
- Ensure compliance with ADA accessibility guidelines, including color contrast and alternative text.  

**Phase 2: Development (Weeks 4–12)**  
- Build Quarto scripts integrated with Python and SQL to generate HTML reports.  
- Implement progressive disclosure features, such as collapsible sections and dynamic text, to reduce cognitive load.  
- Develop mobile-responsive layouts to ensure accessibility on all devices.  

**Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Weeks 13–14)**  
- Conduct thorough testing for:  
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensure accurate representation of provided data.  
  - **Functionality**: Validate interactive features (e.g., collapsible sections).  
  - **Visual Design**: Ensure the design meets DC PCSB’s branding and ADA standards.  
  - **Mobile Usability**: Verify seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices.  

**Phase 4: Delivery and Handover (Week 15)**  
- Deliver Type 1 reports first, followed by Type 2 reports.  
- Provide comprehensive documentation, including a detailed README for GitLab.  
- Conduct user training sessions if needed.  

### **3.3 Technical Implementation**  

Our technical approach includes:  

1. **Framework-Specific Templates**:  
   - Design customized Quarto templates for the 12 ASPIRE frameworks to accommodate varying categories, measures, and subgroups.  

2. **Hierarchical Navigation**:  
   - Use progressive disclosure to organize data intuitively into categories, measures, and subgroups.  

3. **Dynamic Customization**:  
   - Dynamically generate measures, descriptions, and visualizations for school-determined measures.  

4. **School-Framework Interface**:  
   - Create an interface allowing users to select schools and frameworks, ensuring seamless navigation between multiple frameworks.

## 4. Key Features  

- **Responsive Design**: Reports will adapt seamlessly to desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users can expand/collapse sections to view more granular data (e.g., bar charts, measure floors/targets).  
- **Dynamic Text and Charting**: Dynamic data integration into text strings and charts to provide user-specific insights.  
- **ADA Compliance**: Reports will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, focusing on accessibility for all users.  
- **Maintainability**: Code and documentation will be structured for easy updates by DC PCSB’s Data Team.
