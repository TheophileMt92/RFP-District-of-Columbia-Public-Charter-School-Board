## 1. Introduction 

**[Our Organization/Team Name]** is pleased to submit this proposal in response to the DC Public Charter School Board’s (DC PCSB) request for proposals (RFP) for the development of public-facing web-based ASPIRE outcome reports. Our team has extensive experience in creating dynamic, responsive, and accessible data reporting platforms. We are confident in our ability to deliver high-quality HTML-based reports, leveraging Quarto, Python, and SQL, to meet and exceed DC PCSB’s needs.

## 2. Understanding of the Project

We understand that DC PCSB requires two types of ASPIRE outcome reports for each public charter school campus in Washington, D.C.:

- **Type 1 Reports**: Educate the public about the ASPIRE system and display ASPIRE Measure Rates by student subgroup.
- **Type 2 Reports**: Include the content of Type 1 reports along with ASPIRE Measure Scores, Measure Floors, and Targets.

Additionally:

- Reports will be generated using Quarto scripts, Python, and SQL, and hosted within DC PCSB’s GitLab repository.
- Reports should use progressive disclosure to organize information and must be mobile-friendly and ADA-compliant.
- All data will be provided in publication-ready tables from DC PCSB’s AWS Data Warehouse.
- The project involves creating dynamic views to handle variability across frameworks and schools, with attention to missing or suppressed data scenarios.

Our team is well-equipped to meet these technical and functional requirements while adhering to DC PCSB’s standards for accessibility, maintainability, and user-centered design.

## 3. Our Approach
### 3.1 Project Management 

Our team will assign an experienced **Product Manager** to oversee all aspects of this project. The Product Manager will:

-	Serve as the primary point of contact for DC PCSB.
-	Conduct sprint planning, manage feedback loops, and ensure timely delivery of all deliverables.
-	Oversee quality assurance (QA) testing for data, functionality, and visual design.
-	Facilitate regular presentations during the Data Team’s Sprint Review meetings.

### 3.2 Development Process 
We propose the following phased approach to deliver the reports:

#### 1.	Phase 1: Planning and Design
-	Collaborate with DC PCSB to finalize reporting templates for the 12 ASPIRE frameworks.
- Create a cohesive design system using a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) or branded YAML file for consistent aesthetics.
-	Ensure compliance with ADA accessibility guidelines (e.g., color contrast, alternative text, dynamic links).

#### 2.	Phase 2: Development
-	Build Quarto scripts integrated with Python and SQL to generate HTML reports based on the provided data.
-	Develop progressive disclosure features, such as collapsible sections and dynamic data-driven text, to organize information and reduce cognitive load for users.
-	Implement mobile-responsive layouts to ensure reports are accessible across devices.

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance and Testing 
- Conduct thorough testing for:
    - **Data Integrity**: Ensure accurate representation of provided data, including handling missing or suppressed data scenarios.
    - **Functional Testing**: Validate interactive features such as collapsible sections and dynamic charting.
    - **Visual Testing**: Ensure the design meets DC PCSB’s branding and ADA accessibility standards.
    - **Mobile Testing**: Verify usability on desktop and mobile devices.

## 4. Phase 4: Delivery and Handover
- Deliver Type 1 reports first, followed by Type 2 reports.
- Provide comprehensive documentation, including a detailed README in the GitLab repository, to support DC PCSB’s Data Team in maintaining the product.
- Conduct user training sessions as needed.

## 5. Phase 5: Iteration and Feedback
- Present work during DC PCSB’s Sprint Reviews for feedback.
- Incorporate feedback into iterative updates to ensure the reports meet user expectations.

## 4. Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Reports will adapt seamlessly to desktop and mobile devices.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users can expand/collapse sections to view more granular data (e.g., bar charts, measure floors/targets).
- **Dynamic Text and Charting**: Dynamic data integration into text strings and charts to provide user-specific insights.
- **ADA Compliance**: Reports will meet all accessibility standards, including color contrast, alternative text, and consistent heading structures.
- **Maintainability**: Code and documentation will be structured to enable DC PCSB’s Data Team to manage and update reports efficiently.
